<p>This is the site where you will learn about our ongoing project to synthesize the genome – from oligos to chromosomes, and the design features of the new version of Saccharomyces cerevisiae which we fondly refer to as Sc2.0.</p>
<p>Also, these pages describe the Build-A-Genome course, an innovative educational program to engage undergraduate students and others directly in the Sc2.0 project by producing Building Blocks that will be directly used in the project.</p>
<p>These pages also serve as a forum for engaging the yeast and synthetic biology communities in a new initiative to synthesize a modified version of the genome, chromosome by chromosome, from the “bottom up”. We welcome input on the best design features for yeast 2.0 – or future versions. An important aspect of this will be to leverage the formidable collective knowledgebase of the yeast and synthetic biology communities.</p>

Welcome to the synthetic yeast genome web site.
This is the site where you will learn about our ongoing project to synthesize a designer eukaryotic genome – our assembly strategy and the design features of the new version of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome, which we fondly refer to as Sc2.0. Also, these pages describe the Build-A-Genome course, an innovative educational program to engage undergraduate students and others directly in the Sc2.

Ethics & Governance
</a>
</h1>
<div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
A number of guidelines have been proposed in response to the ethics issues, including safety, raised by synthetic biology. Currently, the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules serves as the main document guiding NIH-funded synthetic biology research. These guidelines focus on DNA synthesis companies as the primary point of intervention; other guidelines focus on the researchers themselves. Given the large, international and interdisciplinary nature of the Sc2.0 project, with participants in academia, the commercial sector, and the DIY community, we felt that it was important to address ethics and policy issues in a systematic way across all sites, while remaining sensitive to local and national regulation.

Chemists first probing the structure of matter used analytical approaches, describing what they perceived. They subsequently gained a far more thorough mastery of and insights into chemical compounds by synthesizing them. Biology is now undergoing a similar transition from the age of deciphering DNA sequence information of the genomes of biological species to a synthetic genome age; and this transition demands a whole new level of biological understanding, which we currently lack.

The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been in use by humans since at least the ancient Sumerians and is consumed daily, in various forms, by billions of people. As such, the organism is Generally Regarded As Safe (GRAS) by the United States Food and Drug Association (FDA). Our experiments utilize strains of the BY lineage, directly derived from the S288C strain, which has been undergoing laboratory propagation since its isolation from a rotting fig in Merced, California, in 1938.

S. cerevisiae is the organism of choice for these studies because the genomic and related resources that are available are, quite simply, better than for any other organism on the planet. There are eukaryotes with smaller genomes, to be sure, but the extent of knowledge about these species pales by comparison to S. cerevisiae. This offers the opportunity to bring to bear the extensive universe of yeast systems biology information to the design of chromosomes for the organism.
