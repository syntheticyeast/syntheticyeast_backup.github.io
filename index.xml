This is the site where you will learn about our ongoing project to synthesize a designer eukaryotic genome – our assembly strategy and the design features of the new version of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome, which we fondly refer to as Sc2.0. Also, these pages describe the Build-A-Genome course, an innovative educational program to engage undergraduate students and others directly in the Sc2.</description></item><item><title>6th Annual Sc2.0 Meeting, Singapore</title><link>https://syntheticyeast.github.io/posts/6thannual/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://syntheticyeast.github.io/posts/6thannual/</guid><description>The Synthetic Yeast Genome Project (Sc2.0) is the world’s first synthetic eukaryotic genome project that aims to create a novel, rationalized version of the genome of the yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In a truly global collaborative effort, research teams across the world have embarked on the challenging but exciting task of building 16 designer synthetic chromosomes encompassing ~ 12 million base pairs of DNA.
From 13-16 June 2017, international synthetic biology communities will convene in Singapore for SB7.</description></item><item><title>7th international yeast 2.0 and synthetic genomes conference</title><link>https://syntheticyeast.github.io/posts/7thinternational/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://syntheticyeast.github.io/posts/7thinternational/</guid><description>Synthetic Biology is widely believed to have the potential to make the most profound impact on the way we solve the many grand challenges facing humanity over the next 50 years. Conferences, such as this one, which bring together individuals involved in this field from around the world, are crucial to supercharge the intellectual horsepower required to ‘join the dots’.
The 7th Yeast 2.0 and Synthetic Genomes conference, to be held in the spectacular city of Sydney in November 2018, will provide delegates the opportunity to hear speakers who have made or have the potential to make significant impacts in the synthetic biology world.</description></item><item><title>Alterations</title><link>https://syntheticyeast.github.io/design/alterations/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://syntheticyeast.github.io/design/alterations/</guid><description>We will introduce rather conservative changes to the genome sequence, initially deleting or relocating genomic features using strategies we feel, from first principles, are unlikely to reduce fitness significantly. At the same time, we will be introducing site-specific recombination sequences, allowing subsequent in vitro evolution of the yeast strains generated. This opens up a whole new dimension – not just one synthetic genome, but whole populations of synthetic genomes will be available for analysis and future study.</description></item><item><title>Ethics &amp; Governance</title><link>https://syntheticyeast.github.io/sc20/ethicsandgovernance/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://syntheticyeast.github.io/sc20/ethicsandgovernance/</guid><description>A number of guidelines have been proposed in response to the ethics issues, including safety, raised by synthetic biology. Currently, the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules serves as the main document guiding NIH-funded synthetic biology research. These guidelines focus on DNA synthesis companies as the primary point of intervention; other guidelines focus on the researchers themselves. Given the large, international and interdisciplinary nature of the Sc2.0 project, with participants in academia, the commercial sector, and the DIY community, we felt that it was important to address ethics and policy issues in a systematic way across all sites, while remaining sensitive to local and national regulation.</description></item><item><title>Exchange activities, mentorship, and training</title><link>https://syntheticyeast.github.io/savi/exchange/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://syntheticyeast.github.io/savi/exchange/</guid><description>A variety of mentorship and training experiences, both virtual and physical, have taken place with SAVI support.
The Boeke group, now located at NYU (synI, synIII, synIV, synVI, synVIII, synIX), has developed an ‘Sc2.0 Starter Package’ for distribution to all groups building synthetic chromosomes. This document details protocols relevant to the incorporation of synthetic DNA into yeast cells starting from ~10kb, specifically focusing on the workflow to integrate the first three megachunks of synVI.</description></item><item><title>Goals</title><link>https://syntheticyeast.github.io/sc20/goals/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://syntheticyeast.github.io/sc20/goals/</guid><description>Chemists first probing the structure of matter used analytical approaches, describing what they perceived. They subsequently gained a far more thorough mastery of and insights into chemical compounds by synthesizing them. Biology is now undergoing a similar transition from the age of deciphering DNA sequence information of the genomes of biological species to a synthetic genome age; and this transition demands a whole new level of biological understanding, which we currently lack.</description></item><item><title>GP-W &amp; SC2.0 MEETING</title><link>https://syntheticyeast.github.io/posts/gpwsc20meeting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://syntheticyeast.github.io/posts/gpwsc20meeting/</guid><description>Registration is now open for the 2019 GP-WRITE &amp;amp; 8TH ANNUAL SC2.0 MEETING Hosted by the Institute for Systems Genetics at NYU Langone Health
November 11-14 REGISTER
Synthetic genomics is an emerging field driven by the rapidly decreasing cost of gene synthesis, scalable DNA assembly technologies, and the ever-increasing amount of genome sequence data. To date, convergence of these technologies has enabled total genome synthesis projects targeting viral, bacterial and yeast genomes.</description></item><item><title>International Meetings</title><link>https://syntheticyeast.github.io/savi/international-meetings/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://syntheticyeast.github.io/savi/international-meetings/</guid><description>With support from SAVI, we host an annual Synthetic Yeast Genome Meeting. These meetings provide critical ‘face time’ for all researchers involved in the project to directly interact, in particular the students and postdocs who are the frontline ‘chromosome builders’. Additionally, these meeting attract members from the synthetic biology community, yeast research community, plus representatives from industry. The yearly meeting provides an important opportunity to discuss downstream uses of the synthetic genome and collaborations with groups wishing to get involved in using Sc2.</description></item><item><title>Methodology</title><link>https://syntheticyeast.github.io/design/methodology/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://syntheticyeast.github.io/design/methodology/</guid><description>The strategy to build the Sc2.0 genome is based on a hierarchical assembly plan devised specifically for this project. Building blocks (~750bp) are assembled into minichunks (~3kb), which are assembled into into chunks (~10kb), which are subsequently assembled into megachunks (30-50kb) that can finally be introduced into yeast to replace the corresponding wild type sequence.
Here we will describe the design and workflow associated with assembling chunks into megachunks and yeast transformation.</description></item><item><title>Phenotype Monitoring</title><link>https://syntheticyeast.github.io/design/phenotypemonitoring/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://syntheticyeast.github.io/design/phenotypemonitoring/</guid><description>We use haploid strains allowing simple growth (fitness) tests to be performed after each cycle of incorporating a synthetic segment. A straightforward and relatively sensitive way for us to monitor fitness on an ongoing basis is to examine colony size when the strain is plated out on the appropriate selective and non-selective media and compared to the parental strain(s). However, while this method will readily identify instances in which alterations lead to relatively major fitness defects, minor fitness defects may not be detected and certainly the spectrum of growth conditions examined will be small.</description></item><item><title>Principles</title><link>https://syntheticyeast.github.io/design/principles/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://syntheticyeast.github.io/design/principles/</guid><description>Planned alterations to native chromosome sequence are potentially infinite in number and so a great deal of thought must be given to the specific alterations to be incorporated into the synthetic chromosome(s). In general, we are making modest changes predicted to have minimal or no impact on fitness of the organism under laboratory conditions.
The synthetic DNA encoding the designer changes are introduced in a stepwise, “bottom up” approach. The advantage here is that the “investment” made in the project at any given stage is limited to 30-60kb, so if a particular segment is incompatible with viability, or gives rise to a slow-growth phenotype, the segment can be re-synthesized after the nature of the growth defect is mapped and diagnosed (by singly transforming in the 10kb pieces, or by mapping which segments of a given 30-60 kb “megachunk” are incorporated during transformation [PCRTags].</description></item><item><title>Related Technology</title><link>https://syntheticyeast.github.io/sc20/relatedtechnology/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://syntheticyeast.github.io/sc20/relatedtechnology/</guid><description>This page has no content, but the drop down menu has a ‘sub-link’ to the SCRaMbLEing the genome section – I propose to change this link to go straight to the SCRaMbLE section and re-name it ‘Inducible Evolution by SCRaMbLE’</description></item><item><title>Safety</title><link>https://syntheticyeast.github.io/sc20/safety/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://syntheticyeast.github.io/sc20/safety/</guid><description>The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been in use by humans since at least the ancient Sumerians and is consumed daily, in various forms, by billions of people. As such, the organism is Generally Regarded As Safe (GRAS) by the United States Food and Drug Association (FDA). Our experiments utilize strains of the BY lineage, directly derived from the S288C strain, which has been undergoing laboratory propagation since its isolation from a rotting fig in Merced, California, in 1938.</description></item><item><title>Sc2.0 Data</title><link>https://syntheticyeast.github.io/sc20/data/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://syntheticyeast.github.io/sc20/data/</guid><description>We have successfully synthesized seven chromosomes.

SAVI-sponsored research programs span disciplinary, institutional, geographic, linguistic, and cultural boundaries by bringing together leading international researchers with NSF-funded U.S. institutions. Major goals of SAVI include (i) addressing global scientific challenges at the frontier; (ii) leveraging NSF funding with new global funding opportunities; (iii) providing mentorship and training to junior researchers in the US and abroad; and (iv) catalyzing the sharing of intellectual strengths and unique research facilities globally.</description></item><item><title>Why Yeast?</title><link>https://syntheticyeast.github.io/sc20/whyyeast/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://syntheticyeast.github.io/sc20/whyyeast/</guid><description>S. cerevisiae is the organism of choice for these studies because the genomic and related resources that are available are, quite simply, better than for any other organism on the planet. There are eukaryotes with smaller genomes, to be sure, but the extent of knowledge about these species pales by comparison to S. cerevisiae. This offers the opportunity to bring to bear the extensive universe of yeast systems biology information to the design of chromosomes for the organism.</description></item></channel></rss>
