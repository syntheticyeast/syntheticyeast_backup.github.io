The Boeke group, now located at NYU (synI, synIII, synIV, synVI, synVIII, synIX), has developed an ‘Sc2.0 Starter Package’ for distribution to all groups building synthetic chromosomes. This document details protocols relevant to the incorporation of synthetic DNA into yeast cells starting from ~10kb, specifically focusing on the workflow to integrate the first three megachunks of synVI.</description></item><item><title>International Meetings</title><link>http://example.org/savi/international-meetings/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/savi/international-meetings/</guid><description>With support from SAVI, we host an annual Synthetic Yeast Genome Meeting. These meetings provide critical ‘face time’ for all researchers involved in the project to directly interact, in particular the students and postdocs who are the frontline ‘chromosome builders’. Additionally, these meeting attract members from the synthetic biology community, yeast research community, plus representatives from industry. The yearly meeting provides an important opportunity to discuss downstream uses of the synthetic genome and collaborations with groups wishing to get involved in using Sc2.</description></item><item><title>What is SAVI</title><link>http://example.org/savi/what-is-savi/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/savi/what-is-savi/</guid><description>The Science Across Virtual Institutes (SAVI) program is a groundbreaking funding initiative sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF) to foster international collaboration. SAVI-sponsored research programs span disciplinary, institutional, geographic, linguistic, and cultural boundaries by bringing together leading international researchers with NSF-funded U.S. institutions. Major goals of SAVI include (i) addressing global scientific challenges at the frontier; (ii) leveraging NSF funding with new global funding opportunities; (iii) providing mentorship and training to junior researchers in the US and abroad; and (iv) catalyzing the sharing of intellectual strengths and unique research facilities globally.</description></item></channel></rss>
