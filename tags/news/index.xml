In a truly global collaborative effort, research teams across the world have embarked on the challenging but exciting task of building 16 designer synthetic chromosomes encompassing ~ 12 million base pairs of DNA.
From 13-16 June 2017, international synthetic biology communities will convene in Singapore for SB7.</description></item><item><title>7th international yeast 2.0 and synthetic genomes conference</title><link>http://example.org/posts/7thinternational/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/posts/7thinternational/</guid><description>Synthetic Biology is widely believed to have the potential to make the most profound impact on the way we solve the many grand challenges facing humanity over the next 50 years. Conferences, such as this one, which bring together individuals involved in this field from around the world, are crucial to supercharge the intellectual horsepower required to ‘join the dots’.
The 7th Yeast 2.0 and Synthetic Genomes conference, to be held in the spectacular city of Sydney in November 2018, will provide delegates the opportunity to hear speakers who have made or have the potential to make significant impacts in the synthetic biology world.</description></item><item><title>GP-W &amp; SC2.0 MEETING</title><link>http://example.org/posts/gpwsc20meeting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/posts/gpwsc20meeting/</guid><description>Registration is now open for the 2019 GP-WRITE &amp;amp; 8TH ANNUAL SC2.0 MEETING Hosted by the Institute for Systems Genetics at NYU Langone Health

Synthetic genomics is an emerging field driven by the rapidly decreasing cost of gene synthesis, scalable DNA assembly technologies, and the ever-increasing amount of genome sequence data. To date, convergence of these technologies has enabled total genome synthesis projects targeting viral, bacterial and yeast genomes.</description></item><item><title>Sc2.0 project hits new milestone: 5 additional chromosomes completed!</title><link>http://example.org/posts/newmilestone/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/posts/newmilestone/</guid><description>The global Sc2.0 team has built five new synthetic yeast chromosomes, meaning that 30 percent of S.cerevisiae’s genetic material has now been swapped out for engineered replacements. This is one of several findings of a package of seven papers published March 10 as the cover story for Science.
An international team of more than 200 authors produced the latest work from the Synthetic Yeast Project (Sc2.0). By the end of this year, this international consortium hopes to have designed and built synthetic versions all 16 chromosomes – the structures that contain DNA – for S.</description></item></channel></rss>
